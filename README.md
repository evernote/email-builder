# Evernote Email Builder

> Evernote Email Builder is made up of Grunt tasks that allow our email builds to be more scaleable for re-using code, supporting multiple languages and leveraging new technologies like Sass.

## Getting Started
_If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide._

From the same directory as your project's [Gruntfile][Getting Started] and [package.json][], install the build tasks from the package.json by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Once that's done, you will have added all the npm_modules necessary for the Grunt tasks to run.

### For additional help:
